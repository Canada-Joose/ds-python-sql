# SQL in Python

SQL is a very important language for working with data. People who can write both SQL and Python can work across a
broader spectrum in the data world. How does SQL
combine with python?

In this workshop we will be using Fugue and DuckDB and practice manipulating data using SQL.

Alternatively you can create an account on [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) and use gitpod for the workshop.
